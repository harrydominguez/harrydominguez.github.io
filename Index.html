<h1> Harry Dominguez</h1>






<h2> About Me:</h2>

I am Harry Dominguez and I am from Los Angeles, California. 
I am a sophomore at the University of Wisconsin and I am studying economics with a minor in finance. 
I am a member of the Delta Tau Delta Fraternity which has been a big part of my life here on campus. 
I am super interested in the stock market and I have become relatively involved in trading and selling my own money.
I am undeniably a huge sports fan and I always have been. 
I was born in San Fransisco which explains my love for the 49ers, Giants, and Warriors. 
I am a loyal and rather die-hard fan which played a part in my decision to come to Wisconsin. 
I absolutely love watching the Badgers play at Camp Randall and I am just hoping that someday soon we will be able to be back in the stadium. 
I also am a huge formula one fan which is fairly recent but still a huge part of my life. 
I like to go golfing, play chess, or play Xbox. You can watch some of my clips at <a href="https://xboxclips.co/dopeitsdom3" target="_blank">
