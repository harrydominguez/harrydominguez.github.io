<h2> My Sports Teams</h2>



<h3> The 49ers </h3>

The 49ers are my favorite football team as I grew up watching them with my dad. I have gone to many games as I travel to San Francisco regularly to see family and watch at least one game in person. 


<h3> The Warriors </h3>

 The Golden State Warriors are my favorite basketball team. Similarly to the 49ers, I grew up watching the Warriors and went to many home games at Oracle Arena. The Warriors won 3 championships in the last 6 six years which is extremely impressive. 



<h4> The Giants </h4>

 The San Francisco Giants are my favorite baseball team. Out of these three sports baseball is my favorite as I have been to over 30 SF Giants home games in the last ten years. The Giants had an impressive start to the decade with World Series Wins in 2010, 2012, and 2104.
